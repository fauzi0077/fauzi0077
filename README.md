Hey there! 👋  

I’m Fauzi Halim, an Information Technology graduate based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

I enjoy building practical systems and applications that solve real-world problems, especially in mobile application development and IT systems support.

My main focus areas include Android development, application support, and IoT-based systems. I’ve worked with tools and technologies such as Android Studio, Firebase, SAP systems, NodeMCU (ESP8266), and basic networking configurations.

I recently completed my Final Year Project, **SmartWaste Monitoring System Mobile Application**, an IoT-based Android app that monitors waste bin fill levels in real time and automates lid control to improve waste management efficiency.

I’m currently open to graduate or junior IT roles where I can grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful projects.
